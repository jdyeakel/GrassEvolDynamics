# GrassEvolDynamics

Step 1. incorporate the effects of grazing and browsing into the Staver GSTF model
  * Grazers damage shrubs, which are replaced with grassland
  * Browsers damage trees, which are replaced with grassland
  * The effects of browsers on forests is more complicated. There is some evidence that intense browsing reduces forest cover (white tailed deer, moose in Isle Royale), and a lot more evidence that browsing leads to species turnover rather than changes in forest structure (i.e. going from forest to grassland, etc). There also appears to be a nonlinear relationship between browsing intensity and tree production per unit biomass. Possibilities: 
    * treat forest mortality from browsing as natural mortality such that it turns into grassland 
    * browsing on forests impacts tree birth rates (alpha) nonlinearly, such that low browsing intercepts some baseline alpha; intermediate browsing increases alpha; intense browsing leads to a lower-than-baseline alpha

Note to self: get feedback on project idea from Trevor Price.
